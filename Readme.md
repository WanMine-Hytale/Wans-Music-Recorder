# Wan's Echoes of Resonance

NOTE: It seems like the mod has a problem where if you build it, JAVE does not get included in the jar, causing the mod to not work. But if you run it via IntelliJ it will work. We are working hard on fixing it.

System Summary

Rosanance Scriptor → compose music manually, engraving notes into a song Resonance Core → saves the composed song as a physical item Echo Resonator → plays the saved song back in the world

1) ### Rosanance Scriptor (Composition Block)
    #### Lore: 
    An ancient machine born at the intersection of music and mechanics. The Resonance Scriptor engraves sound directly into matter, transforming melodies into enduring mechanical echoes. Each note carved within it lingers, resonating long after the player’s hands have left the keys.

    #### Gameplay Features: 
    This block allows the player to compose music directly. Players create songs note by note, using musical notes, timing, and rhythm rather than simply selecting a pre-made track. The Scriptor acts as a music engraving station, converting the player’s composition into a physical, storable form. Once a composition is complete, it can be saved onto a Resonance Core (music disk).

    #### Controls:
    Add / Remove disk: Crouch + Use. Open GUI: Use.

2) ### Resonance Crystal (Disk item)
    #### Lore: 
    A crystallized imprint of a melody, preserved as a fragment of lingering resonance. Each Resonance Core holds the memory of a song frozen in time, yet waiting to be awakened.

    #### Gameplay Features: 
    Functions as a music disk. Stores a song composed using the Resonance Scriptor. Each Resonance Core can hold one unique composition created by the player. Can be inserted into playback devices to reproduce the stored music.

3) ### Echo Resonator (Playback Block)
    #### Lore: 
    A forgotten device designed to give voice to the past. The Echo Resonator releases engraved melodies from Resonance Cores, allowing dormant machines and ancient halls to sing once more.

    #### Gameplay Features: 
    Used to play back music stored on Resonance Cores. When a disk is inserted, the block reproduces the exact song composed by the player. Acts as the final step in the music system: composition → storage → playback.

   #### Controls:
   Add / Remove disk: Use.
